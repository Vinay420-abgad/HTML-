        <h1><p>Information about c++</p></h1>
        <p>C++ is a high-level, general-purpose programming language developed by Bjarne Stroustrup in <b>1979</b>. It supports procedural, object-oriented, and generic programming, making it fast, powerful, and portable. Commonly used in <b>system software</b>, <b>game development</b>, and <b>applications</b>.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>★ Key Features of c++ :-</h2>
        <p>1. <b>Simple & Efficient</b> – Easy to learn (if you know C) and runs fast.</p>
        <p>2. <b>Object-Oriented</b> – Supports classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation.</p>
        <p>3. <b>Portable</b> – Can run the same code on different platforms.</p>
        <p>4. <b>Rich Library (STL)</b> – Provides built-in data structures and algorithms.</p>
        <p>5. <b>Memory Management</b> – Allows low-level memory access with pointers.</p>
        <p>6. <b>Multi-paradigm</b> – Supports procedural, object-oriented, and generic programming.</p>
        <p>7. <b>High Performance</b> – Used for speed-critical applications (games, OS, compilers).</p>
