            <h2><em><a style="color:blue">Information About C++</a></em> :-</h2>
            <p>C++ is a general-purpose programming language developed by <q><b><i>Bjarne Stroustrup</i></b></q> as an extension of the C language, adding object-oriented programming (OOP) features. It is considered an <b>intermediate-level language</b> because it combines features of both <b>high-level</b> and <strong>low-level</strong> languages. </p>

            <h3>Key characteristics of C++</h3>
            <p>
                <b>Object-Oriented Programming :-</b><br>
                C++ supports core OOP concepts like classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation, which promote modularity, reusability, and maintainability in large software projects.
                <br><br>
                <b>Performance :-</b><br>
                C++ offers high performance and efficiency due to its ability to directly manipulate memory and system resources, making it suitable for applications requiring speed, such as game engines, operating systems, and embedded systems.
                <br><br>
                <b>System Level programming :-</b><br>
                It provides low-level capabilities, including direct memory access and system-level programming, which are crucial for developing operating systems, compilers, and device drivers.
                <br><br>
                <b>Portability :-</b><br>
                C++ code can be compiled and run on various platforms, including Windows, macOS, and Linux, making it a versatile choice for cross-platform development.
                <br><br>
                <b>Standard library :-</b><br>
                C++ includes a rich standard library that provides a wide range of pre-built functionalities and data structures, simplifying the development of complex applications.
                <br><br>
                <b>Manual Memory Management :-</b><br>
                Unlike some other languages, C++ requires manual memory management, giving programmers fine-grained control over memory allocation and deallocation, which can lead to optimized performance but also introduces the possibility of memory-related errors if not handled carefully.
