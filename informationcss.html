            <h4><em>Key aspects of CSS include :-</em></h4>
            <b><em>Seperations of Concerns :</em></b><br>
            CSS allows for the separation of content (HTML) from its presentation (CSS). This makes web development more organized, efficient, and easier to maintain.
            <br><br>
            <b><em>Styling Web Pages :</em></b><br>
            CSS is used to control the visual appearance of web pages, including elements such a <em><b>colors, fonts, spacing, layout, and even animations</b></em>.
            <br><br>
            <b><em>Cascading Nature :</em></b><br>
            The <q>Cascading</q> in CSS refers to the set of rules that determine which styles are applied when multiple styles conflict. This system prioritizes styles based on factors like specificity, importance, and source order.
            <br><br>
            <b><em>Syntax:</em></b><br>
            CSS consists of rules that are applied to elements using selectors. A rule typically includes a selector (e.g., <mark>p</mark> for paragraphs, <mark>.my-class</mark> for elements with a specific class) and a declaration block containing one or more declarations. Each declaration consists of a property (e.g., <mark>color</mark>,<mark> font-size</mark>) and its corresponding value (e.g., <mark>blue</mark>, <mark>16px</mark>).
            <br><br>
            <b><em>Advantages:</em></b><br>
            CSS offers numerous benefits, including faster website loading times due to smaller file sizes, improved consistency across multiple pages, easier maintenance and updates, and enhanced flexibility in design.
            <br><br>
            <b><em>Usage:</em></b><br>
            CSS can be applied to html document in several ways :
            <ul>
                <li><b><em>External Style Sheets :</em></b> Linking a <mark>.css</mark> file to the html document.</li>
                <li><b><em>Internal Style Sheets :</em></b> Embedded CSS within <mark>Style</mark> tags in html document's <mark>Head</mark>.</li>
                <li><b><em>Inline Styles :</em></b> Applying styles directly to individual HTML elements using the <mark>style</mark> attribute.</li>
